# stack
The project aims to create a stack data structure implementation. 
It consists of four components that handle the basic stack operations.

The functionalities include stack initialization, adding new elements, 
retrieving the top element, finding a specific element, and saving and
reading stack elements from a file. 

The stack is implemented using 
pointers, allowing for flexibility with different data types.
The project also provides a user interface that displays the 
stack contents and allows interaction through a menu. 

The data stored on the stack is represented by the MY_STUDENT structure,
which includes information such as the student's name, year of birth, and field of study. 
The project follows a modular approach, with each component encapsulated in separate files. 
The core stack operations have been thoroughly tested, including the saving and reading of data from a file.
